Flutter app to practice multiplication

This app is based on the Flutter calculator example in Kenneth Reilly's article: 
https://itnext.io/building-a-calculator-app-in-flutter-824254704fe6

This app "gamifies" multiplication where the user has to answer increasingly difficult equations.
The user has a set time to provide an answer. 
10 consequitive correct answers is rewarded with a level up.
What level is possible to achieve is unknown :-), but equations reach a ridiculous complexity around level 12...

Usage of streams is particularly helpful in Flutter, as this example confirms.
